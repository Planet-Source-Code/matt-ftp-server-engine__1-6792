## FTP Server Engine


</div>

### Description

Im sure many of you remember my old FTP server I posted here a few months back - <A HREF="http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?lngWId=1&txtCodeId=4930">HERE</A>. Well this is another attempt at making a better, easier to use FTP server. You could take the server class module and drop it into any program to make it an FTP server without having to do anything inside the server. This server uses the Winsock API instead of the winsock control like the old one I posted. Another great feature is that the server is now event driven which makes using the server MUCH easier. This is just a demo program to show off the FTP server, I did almost no work on the user interface... The server is by no means done, probably not even usable in its current state. All it can do right now is list directories and navigate them. I am still in the process of completing it. I just wanted to post it and get some feedback.
